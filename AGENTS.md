# Nyan Agent Skills

This repository is a library of independent Codex skills.

## Library structure

- Store every skill at `skills/<skill-name>/`.
- Name the folder exactly as the `name` in `SKILL.md`.
- Keep reusable instructions in `SKILL.md`.
- Store optional resources only in `agents/`, `references/`, `scripts/`, or `assets/`.
- Do not add a README, changelog, or installation guide inside an individual skill.

## Skill requirements

- Use lowercase letters, digits, and hyphens for skill names.
- Include only `name` and `description` in YAML frontmatter.
- Put all trigger conditions in the frontmatter description.
- Write body instructions in imperative form.
- Keep `SKILL.md` concise and use one-level references for detailed material.
- Add `agents/openai.yaml` with a display name, short description, and default prompt.
- Do not add dependencies unless the skill requires them.

## Validation

Run the skill validator after each material change:

```powershell
python "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\.system\skill-creator\scripts\quick_validate.py" "skills\<skill-name>"
```

Test scripts by running them. Verify any skill that changes rendered output against the actual artifact, not source code alone.

## Catalog maintenance

Add each skill to the root `README.md`. Describe its purpose in one sentence and link to its folder. Keep library-wide guidance here instead of copying it into every skill.
